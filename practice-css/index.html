       <p>Within this period of learning, i've learnt about<strong><em> Git and Github, HTML and CSS.</em></strong> I gained knowledge about how github which is a version control system used for storing and sharing codes, collaborating on software development projects.<strong> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is used to structure the content of the webpages.<strong> CSS (Cascading style sheets)</strong> is used to style websites to make them look appealing and attractive. CSS is important because it gives the webpage a beautiful and user-friendly interface. it enables a proper layout and makes navigation easy for users. Without CSS, our webpages will look dull and uninteresting</p>
